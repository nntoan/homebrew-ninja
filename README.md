Homebrew-ninja
===============
These formulae duplicate software provided by OS X, though may provide more recent or bugfix versions.
They may also provide conflicting formulae that I consider to be more desirable, i.e. the latest hpn-ssh
enabled version of openssh instead of the absolute latest.

How do I install these formulae?
--------------------------------
Just `brew tap nntoan/ninja` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one from mxcl/master or another tap, you can `brew install nntoan/ninja/<formula>`.

You can also install via URL:

```
brew install https://raw.github.com/nntoan/homebrew-ninja/master/<formula>.rb
```
